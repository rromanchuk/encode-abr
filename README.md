## Use the SAM CLI to build and test locally

Build your application with the `sam build` command.

```bash
encoder-abr$ sam build --use-container
```

The SAM CLI builds a docker image from a Dockerfile and then installs dependencies defined in `hello_world/Gemfile` inside the docker image. The processed template file is saved in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command.

```bash
encoder-abr$ sam local invoke EcodeAbrFunction --event events/sqs.json
```

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs generated by your deployed Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
encoder$ sam logs -n EcodeAbrFunction --stack-name encoder-app -t
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).
